I have lost all sense of where I am in the course. I simply have lost too much time and fallen too far behind. What I can do is try to sum up what I have learned. I also have been thinking about what would have changed when I worked on my MA and PhD, had I beeen immersed in this form of history when I started. Perhaps we could say what the grad student of ten years from now might be doing as a matter of course. 
I have been introduced to new places in which to work -- for example Git Hub where I am now. So I have gone beyond dropbox. I am not convinced though that I will use these. I am either old-fashioned or paranoid. Hard to say which but while I do not trust the big corporations, I also do not trust the cloud. My data does not sit in some kind of heavenly ether. It is on a physical computer somewhere. If I trust blindly in, as one example, google drive, there is a likelihood my "stuff" sits on a computer somewhere in the United States and is thereby subject to American laws. Years ago I worked as an Industry Canada representative on a project dealing with lawful intercept of telecom and internet communications. I came out of that project even more distrustful than I had been going in. I want my "stuff" to be under my physical control.
I was forced in the course to articulate my reaction against large claims that digital history is wonderfully revolutionary. I found as I read deeper into those writing on the subject that they were not naively wearing rose-glasses. Perhaps the large claims have been necessary to bring attention to the potential and the credibiity of digital history. My own sense as I worked through the rassigned readings is that digital history is an extension not a fundamental change. The  requirement forevide nce be the central building block of arguments, to question the evidence and to ask oneself the so-what questions are still there. There is one thing that has changed and that is the range of forms in which sources come to us.  Again, however, it is an extension. Just as in the past historians had to shift from reading the physical document itself, with all the attendent dust and grime, to squinting at microfiches and microforms, so historians now are stretched further to consider how to understand digitized records. We still have the same questions - why was the sources created in the first place, why was it preserved across the yearso and now why it is given to the historian in whatever format, whether original, microform/microfiche or digital. And for all of these points the same questions have to be answered -- by whom, for whom, in what context, for what purpose, what has been lost versus what has been preserved.
I was brought face to face with my unthinking acceptance of Word with the requirement to work in markdown -- as I am doing now. I realize I have enjoyed too much the sense of accomplishment by seeing my work immediately "look good" and did not consider the price of this polish. Certainly I grumble about the defaults which force me into Word's idea of the proper font, spacing between paragraphs and so. As a TA I have exhorted students to go in and turn off defaullts and been amazed each year at the ignorance of many in this computer-savy generation with the workings of the software they use. As I lay-out for print an Association's newsletters, I curse it for its unfitness for the task. And I have suffered near melt-downs when time after time it threw my dissertation into an endless pagination due to a particular graphic in chapter five (although I learned the secret of shifting into "draft" to unfreeze the document so I could copy and paste everything except the offending but buried bit of code into a new document and then reenter the graphic with the text immediately surrounding it).
